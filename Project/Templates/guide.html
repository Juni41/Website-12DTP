        <section id="intro">
            <h2>1. What Is The Support Role?</h2>
            <p>The support role in League of Legends is one of the five main roles on a team. As a support, your primary responsibility is to assist your teammates, especially your AD carry (ADC) in the bottom lane, in gaining an advantage over the enemy team. Supports achieve this through a combination of vision control, peeling (protecting your carries), crowd control (CC), and utility.</p>
            <p><b>Key Responsibilities:</b></p>
            <li>
                <b>Protecting Your Carry:</b>Use your abilities and items to keep your ADC alive, allowing them to farm and deal damage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Vision Control:</b>Place wards to provide vision of key areas of the map, preventing ganks and providing information on enemy movements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Crowd Control:</b>Use your CC abilities (stuns, slows, roots, etc.) to lock down enemies and initiate or disengage from fights.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Utility:</b>Buff, heal, or shield your allies, and debuff or disrupt enemies.
            </li>
        </section>

        <section id="laning">
            <h2>2. The Laning Phase</h2>
            <p>The laning phase is where you and your ADC share the bottom lane and attempt to secure an early lead by farming minions, denying the enemy farm, and possibly securing kills.</p>
            <p><b>Goals During Laning:</b></p>
            <li>
                <b>Zoning:</b>Position yourself to deny the enemy ADC from safely farming minions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Trading:</b>Use your abilities to poke the enemy ADC and support, ensuring favorable health trades.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Protecting:</b>Shield, heal, or otherwise protect your ADC when they are under threat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Engaging/Disengaging:</b>Decide when to go for an all-in fight or when to back off, depending on the situation and your champion's kit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Securing Farm:</b>Although you don't typically last-hit minions (unless using a support item that allows it), help your ADC secure their last-hits and share the gold generated from your support item.
            </li>

        <section id="Vision">
            <h2>3. Warding and Vision Control</h2>
            <p>Vision control is one of the most critical aspects of the support role. Proper warding can prevent ganks, allow for safe objectives, and provide crucial information about enemy movements.</p>
            <p><b>Types of Wards:</b></p>
            <li>
                <b>Stealth Ward (Totem):</b>A basic ward that provides vision in an area for a limited time. Itâ€™s invisible to enemies unless they have things like an orcale lens or a control ward.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control Ward:</b>Reveals and disables nearby enemy wards and traps. Place these in key areas to deny enemy vision.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Farsight Alteration:</b>A ward that grants vision in a specific area indefinitely but can be destroyed with a single attack not typically bought on supports.
            </li>
            <h2><b>Warding Strategy:</b></h2>
            <li>
                <b>Early Game:</b>Focus on warding the river to prevent ganks. Key spots include the river bush, tri-brush, and dragon area.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mid to Late Game:</b>Shift your wards to more aggressive positions in the enemy jungle or around objectives like Baron Nashor and Dragon. This gives your team control over these key areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sweeping:</b>Use Oracle Lens to clear enemy wards, especially before setting up for objectives or ganks to deny the enemies time to react.
            </li>
            <h2><b>Key Ward Spots:</b></h2>
            <li>
                <b>Lane Bushes:</b> Place wards in the bushes in the bottom lane to prevent enemy support from hiding and engaging.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Jungle Entrances:</b>Ward entrances to your jungle to spot incoming invades or ganks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Objectives:</b>Always ward around major objectives like Dragon and Baron.
            </li>

        <section id="Roam">
            <h2><b>4. Roaming and Map Awareness</b></h2>
            <p>Roaming is an essential part of playing support, especially after the early laning phase. Effective roaming can lead to successful ganks in other lanes or help secure objectives.</p>
