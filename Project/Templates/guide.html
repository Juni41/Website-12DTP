            <h2>1. What Is The Support Role?</h2>
            <p>The support role in League of Legends is one of the five main roles on a team. As a support, your primary responsibility is to assist your teammates, especially your AD carry (ADC) in the bottom lane, in gaining an advantage over the enemy team. Supports achieve this through a combination of vision control, peeling (protecting your carries), crowd control (CC), and utility.</p>
