            <section id="intro">
                <h2>1. What Is The Support Role?</h2>
                <p>The support role in League of Legends is one of the five main roles on a team. As a support, your primary responsibility is to assist your teammates, especially your AD carry (ADC) in the bottom lane, in gaining an advantage over the enemy team. Supports achieve this through a combination of vision control, peeling (protecting your carries), crowd control (CC), and utility.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Protecting Your Carry:</b> Use your abilities and items to keep your ADC alive, allowing them to farm and deal damage.</li>
                    <li><b>Vision Control:</b> Place wards to provide vision of key areas of the map, preventing ganks and providing information on enemy movements.</li>
                    <li><b>Crowd Control:</b> Use your CC abilities (stuns, slows, roots, etc.) to lock down enemies and initiate or disengage from fights.</li>
                    <li><b>Utility:</b> Buff, heal, or shield your allies, and debuff or disrupt enemies.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="laning">
                <h2>2. The Laning Phase</h2>
                <p>The laning phase is where you and your ADC share the bottom lane and attempt to secure an early lead by farming minions, denying the enemy farm, and possibly securing kills.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Zoning:</b> Position yourself to deny the enemy ADC from safely farming minions.</li>
                    <li><b>Trading:</b> Use your abilities to poke the enemy ADC and support, ensuring favorable health trades.</li>
                    <li><b>Protecting:</b> Shield, heal, or otherwise protect your ADC when they are under threat.</li>
                    <li><b>Engaging/Disengaging:</b> Decide when to go for an all-in fight or when to back off, depending on the situation and your champion's kit.</li>
                    <li><b>Securing Farm:</b> Although you don't typically last-hit minions (unless using a support item that allows it), help your ADC secure their last-hits and share the gold generated from your support item.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="vision">
                <h2>3. Warding and Vision Control</h2>
                <p>Vision control is one of the most critical aspects of the support role. Proper warding can prevent ganks, allow for safe objectives, and provide crucial information about enemy movements.</p>
                <h3><b>Types of Wards:</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Stealth Ward (Totem):</b> A basic ward that provides vision in an area for a limited time. It’s invisible to enemies unless they have Oracle Lens or a Control Ward.</li>
                    <li><b>Control Ward:</b> Reveals and disables nearby enemy wards and traps. Place these in key areas to deny enemy vision.</li>
                    <li><b>Farsight Alteration:</b> A ward that grants vision in a specific area indefinitely but can be destroyed with a single attack. Not typically bought on supports.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>Warding Strategy:</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Early Game:</b> Focus on warding the river to prevent ganks. Key spots include the river bush, tri-brush, and dragon area.</li>
                    <li><b>Mid to Late Game:</b> Shift your wards to more aggressive positions in the enemy jungle or around objectives like Baron Nashor and Dragon. This gives your team control over these key areas.</li>
                    <li><b>Sweeping:</b> Use Oracle Lens to clear enemy wards, especially before setting up for objectives or ganks to deny the enemies time to react.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>Key Ward Spots:</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lane Bushes:</b> Place wards in the bushes in the bottom lane to prevent enemy support from hiding and engaging.</li>
                    <li><b>Jungle Entrances:</b> Ward entrances to your jungle to spot incoming invades or ganks.</li>
                    <li><b>Objectives:</b> Always ward around major objectives like Dragon and Baron.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="roam">
                <h2>4. Roaming and Map Awareness</h2>
                <p>Roaming is an essential part of playing support, especially after the early laning phase. Effective roaming can lead to successful ganks in other lanes or help secure objectives.</p>
                <h3><b>Early Roaming</b></h3>
                <p>A good support often roams to other lanes, particularly mid-lane or jungle, to help secure kills, apply pressure, or secure objectives. Roaming is effective when the ADC can farm safely under turret, or when the lane is pushed into the enemy tower.</p>
                <h3><b>Securing Objectives:</b></h3>
                <p>Supports also help secure important objectives like Dragon or Baron. Their warding and crowd control abilities help their team maintain control around objectives or disrupt the enemy team’s attempts to take them.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="stage">
                <h2>The Support Role Throughout the Game</h2>
                <h3>Early Game (Laning Phase):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The primary focus is protecting the ADC, helping to secure minions, and harassing the enemy bot lane when safe. During this phase, supports should also focus on warding the river and key areas to prevent ganks from the enemy jungler.</li>
                    <li>Some supports may also roam to the mid-lane or help the jungler with objectives after pushing the wave.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Mid Game:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the game progresses, the support’s role shifts towards roaming and providing vision across the map. Supports often help their jungler secure vision around Dragons, Baron, or enemy camps, while continuing to protect the carries in skirmishes.</li>
                    <li>Supports are often instrumental in setting up team fights or picks by using their crowd control abilities to lock down key targets.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Late Game:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the late game, supports play a critical role in team fights. Whether through engaging, peeling, or providing utility, the support’s job is to keep their team alive and create openings for their carries to deal damage.</li>
                    <li>Vision control around Baron and Dragon Soul becomes even more critical, and supports need to help secure these objectives by clearing enemy wards and placing vision for their team.</li>
                </ul>
